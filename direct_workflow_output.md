## PRD Document

Okay, let's create a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a "simple 2D game in Python." Since the request is very open-ended, this PRD will define a specific type of simple game to provide concrete requirements.

We will define a simple arcade-style game where the player collects items while avoiding obstacles.

**Product Requirements Document: Simple 2D Python Game (Project Codename: "PyCollector")**

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2023-10-27
**Author:** [Your Name/Team Name]

**1. Introduction**

**1.1. Purpose**
This document outlines the requirements for the development of a simple 2D game implemented in Python. The primary goal is to create a functional, playable game that demonstrates basic 2D game development concepts using a suitable Python game library. This project serves as an educational exercise, a portfolio piece, or a foundation for more complex games.

**1.2. Goals**
*   Develop a fully playable simple 2D game.
*   Implement core game mechanics: player movement, item collection, obstacle avoidance, scoring, win/loss conditions.
*   Utilize a standard Python 2D game library (e.g., Pygame).
*   Ensure the game runs on common desktop operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).
*   Keep the complexity low to align with the "simple" requirement.

**1.3. Scope**
This PRD covers the requirements for the initial version (V1) of the "PyCollector" game.

**In Scope (V1):**
*   A single-player game experience.
*   Basic player character with keyboard controls.
*   Collectible items that increase the score.
*   Static obstacles that cause the player to lose.
*   Collision detection between player and items/obstacles.
*   A simple scoring system displayed on screen.
*   Clear win and lose conditions.
*   A basic game over state display.
*   Running the game from a Python script.

**Out of Scope (V1):**
*   Multiple levels.
*   Moving obstacles or enemies.
*   Power-ups or special abilities.
*   Advanced animations or particle effects.
*   Sound effects or background music (optional stretch goal).
*   Main menu, pause screen, high score system.
*   Saving/loading game state.
*   Multiplayer functionality.
*   Complex UI elements.
*   Executable packaging (e.g., .exe, .app).

**2. User Stories**

As a Player:
*   I want to start the game easily.
*   I want to control my character's movement using the keyboard (e.g., Arrow Keys or WASD).
*   I want to see my character move smoothly on the screen.
*   I want to see items appear on the screen that I can collect.
*   I want to see obstacles appear on the screen that I should avoid.
*   I want to collect an item by touching it with my character.
*   I want my score to increase when I collect an item.
*   I want to lose the game if I touch an obstacle.
*   I want to win the game if I collect all the required items.
*   I want to see a message indicating if I won or lost.
*   I want to see my final score when the game ends.
*   (Optional) I want to be able to restart the game after it ends.

**3. Functional Requirements**

**3.1. Game Initialization**
*   **REQ-INIT-1:** The game shall create a window of a fixed size (e.g., 800x600 pixels).
*   **REQ-INIT-2:** The game shall display a background.
*   **REQ-INIT-3:** The game shall instantiate a player character at a starting position.
*   **REQ-INIT-4:** The game shall randomly place a predefined number of collectible items within the game area.
*   **REQ-INIT-5:** The game shall randomly place a predefined number of static obstacles within the game area, ensuring they do not overlap initially with the player or items.
*   **REQ-INIT-6:** The game shall initialize the player's score to zero.
*   **REQ-INIT-7:** The game shall enter the main game loop state.

**3.2. Player Control**
*   **REQ-PLAYER-1:** The game shall detect keyboard input (e.g., Up, Down, Left, Right Arrow keys, or W, S, A, D keys).
*   **REQ-PLAYER-2:** Based on the input, the player character shall move in the corresponding direction.
*   **REQ-PLAYER-3:** The player character's movement speed shall be constant.
*   **REQ-PLAYER-4:** The player character shall be constrained within the bounds of the game window.

**3.3. Game Objects**
*   **REQ-OBJECT-1:** The Player shall be represented by a visual sprite.
*   **REQ-OBJECT-2:** Collectible Items shall be represented by a distinct visual sprite (e.g., coins, stars).
*   **REQ-OBJECT-3:** Obstacles shall be represented by a distinct visual sprite (e.g., rocks, spikes).
*   **REQ-OBJECT-4:** Each object (Player, Item, Obstacle) shall have a position and size for collision detection.

**3.4. Game Logic**
*   **REQ-LOGIC-1:** The game shall continuously update the state of game objects (primarily player position based on input).
*   **REQ-LOGIC-2:** The game shall detect collisions between the Player and each Collectible Item.
*   **REQ-LOGIC-3:** Upon collision with a Collectible Item:
    *   The item shall be removed from the screen.
    *   The player's score shall increase by a predefined amount (e.g., 1 point per item).
*   **REQ-LOGIC-4:** The game shall detect collisions between the Player and each Obstacle.
*   **REQ-LOGIC-5:** Upon collision with an Obstacle, the game shall transition to the Game Over (Lose) state.
*   **REQ-LOGIC-6:** The game shall check for the Win condition: when all collectible items have been collected.
*   **REQ-LOGIC-7:** Upon meeting the Win condition, the game shall transition to the Game Over (Win) state.

**3.5. Scoring**
*   **REQ-SCORE-1:** The current score shall be displayed on the screen, typically in a corner.
*   **REQ-SCORE-2:** The score display shall update whenever an item is collected.

**3.6. Game States**
*   **REQ-STATE-1:** The game shall have a "Running" state where gameplay occurs.
*   **REQ-STATE-2:** The game shall have a "Game Over" state (covering both Win and Lose).
*   **REQ-STATE-3:** In the "Game Over" state, gameplay shall cease.
*   **REQ-STATE-4:** In the "Game Over" state, a message indicating the outcome (Win/Lose) shall be displayed.
*   **REQ-STATE-5:** In the "Game Over" state, the final score shall be displayed.
*   **REQ-STATE-6:** (Optional) Allow the player to press a key (e.g., 'R') in the "Game Over" state to restart the game, returning to the Initialization state.
*   **REQ-STATE-7:** The player shall be able to close the game window at any time to exit.

**3.7. Rendering**
*   **REQ-RENDER-1:** The game shall render the background.

*   **REQ-RENDER-4:** The game shall render all Obstacle sprites at their current positions.
*   **REQ-RENDER-5:** The game shall render the current score text.
*   **REQ-RENDER-6:** In the "Game Over" state, the game shall render the outcome message and final score.
*   **REQ-RENDER-7:** The game shall refresh the display at a consistent frame rate (e.g., 30-60 FPS).

**4. Non-Functional Requirements**

*   **NFR-PERF-1:** The game shall run smoothly without significant lag on a typical modern desktop computer.
*   **NFR-PERF-2:** The game should maintain a frame rate of at least 30 FPS during gameplay.
*   **NFR-USABILITY-1:** Controls shall be intuitive and responsive.
*   **NFR-USABILITY-2:** Visual feedback (item disappears, score updates, game over message) shall be clear.
*   **NFR-TECH-1:** The game shall be written entirely in Python.
*   **NFR-TECH-2:** The game shall primarily use the Pygame library for graphics, input, and game loop management.
*   **NFR-TECH-3:** The code should be reasonably organized and commented for maintainability and educational purposes.
*   **NFR-COMPAT-1:** The game should be runnable on Windows, macOS, and Linux environments with Python and Pygame installed.

**5. Design Considerations**

**5.1. Visuals (Art Style)**
*   Simple, clear 2D sprites.
*   A consistent, albeit basic, art style.
*   Placeholder graphics are acceptable for initial development.

**5.2. User Interface (UI)**
*   Minimal UI: primarily the score display.
*   Game Over messages should be centrally located and easy to read.

**5.3. Sound (Optional Stretch Goal)**
*   Simple sound effects for item collection, collision, win, and lose.
*   No background music required for V1.

**6. Technical Considerations**

*   **Language:** Python 3.x
*   **Primary Library:** Pygame
*   **Architecture:** A standard game loop structure (initialize, game loop with event handling, updates, drawing). Separation of game logic, rendering, and input handling is recommended but can be kept simple.
*   **Assets:** Image files for sprites (e.g., PNG). Text rendering for score and messages.
*   **Collision Detection:** Rectangular collision detection provided by Pygame is sufficient.

**7. Future Considerations (Potential V2 Features)**

*   Multiple levels with increasing difficulty.
*   Different types of items or obstacles.
*   Moving obstacles or simple enemy AI.
*   Power-ups (speed boost, invincibility).
*   Main menu and pause functionality.
*   High score tracking.
*   Sound effects and background music implementation.
*   More sophisticated graphics or animations.

**8. Open Issues / Questions**

*   What specific sprites will be used for the player, items, and obstacles? (Placeholder needed initially).
*   What are the exact dimensions of the game window? (800x600 suggested).
*   How many items and obstacles should appear initially? (e.g., 10 items, 5 obstacles).
*   What is the exact points value for collecting an item? (e.g., 1 point).
*   What specific keys will be used for player movement? (Arrow keys or WASD).
*   Is the optional restart functionality (REQ-STATE-6) desired for V1?

#    You can download it from python.org.
#
# 2. (Recommended) Create a virtual environment for the project.
#    This keeps project dependencies separate from your global Python installation.
#    Open your terminal or command prompt in the desired project directory and run:
#    python -m venv venv
#    (Use 'python3' instead of 'python' on some systems)
#
# 3. Activate the virtual environment.
#    - On Windows:
#      venv\Scripts\activate
#    - On macOS/Linux:
#      source venv/bin/activate
#
# 4. Install Pygame.
#    With the virtual environment active, run:
#    pip install pygame
#
# 5. Save the following code as a Python file (e.g., 'game.py')
#    inside your project directory.
#
# 6. Run the script.
#    With the virtual environment active, run:
#    python game.py
#    (Use 'python3' instead of 'python' on some systems)
#    You should see a blank window pop up. Close the window to exit the game.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Setup Instructions:** The comments at the top guide the user through setting up a virtual environment, installing Pygame using `pip`, and how to save and run the Python file. This covers the "Set up the Python environment, install Pygame" part of the task.
2.  **Import Libraries:** `pygame` is imported to access its functions. `sys` is imported for `sys.exit()`, which is a clean way to exit the program.
3.  **Constants:** Defines basic constants like screen dimensions and common colors. Using constants makes the code more readable and easier to modify.
4.  **Initialization:** `pygame.init()` initializes all the necessary Pygame modules. `pygame.display.set_mode()` creates the game window (surface) with the specified dimensions. `pygame.display.set_caption()` sets the title bar text of the window.
5.  **Game Loop:** The `while running:` loop is the heart of the game. As long as `running` is `True`, the game continues.
6.  **Event Handling:** The `for event in pygame.event.get():` loop checks for events. The most basic event handled here is `pygame.QUIT`, which occurs when the user clicks the window's close button. If this event happens, `running` is set to `False`, breaking the main game loop.
7.  **Game State Updates (Placeholder):** A `pass` statement is included as a placeholder for where game logic (like moving characters, checking for collisions) will be added in future tasks.
8.  **Drawing:** `screen.fill(BLACK)` clears the screen in each frame by filling it with the background color (black in this case). Placeholders for drawing game elements are commented out.
9.  **Update Display:** `pygame.display.flip()` updates the entire screen to show what has been drawn. This is essential to make the drawing commands visible.
10. **Quit Pygame:** Once the `running` loop finishes (because `running` was set to `False`), `pygame.quit()` uninitializes Pygame, and `sys.exit()` terminates the script cleanly.

This code provides the minimal structure required for a Pygame application and fulfills the requirements of Task 1.0. When run, it will open a black window that closes when the user clicks the 'X' button.
