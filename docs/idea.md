This project aims to develop a 2D Action RPG in the style of Diablo, featuring procedurally generated dungeons.
Clarifying Questions: What is the target platform(s) for this game (e.g., PC, mobile)? What are the core gameplay mechanics beyond combat and dungeon exploration that you envision (e.g., crafting, leveling systems, specific character classes)?

in this game I was thinking that we build it to be a diablo like rogue lite but what makes it different would be that gear is infinitely mergable. there would x amount of base items but using an algorithm and some possible ai to generate some names and use a seed to give us random tiers of items in the game would then when getting a certain tier of item after merging give you a terminate traceable card that since you were the first one to find it its yours to keep forever. since there would be theoretically infinite combinations this would essentially have rare or cool items that no one else would have. Not just an item with different stats. I was thinking something like merging 3 items to get 1 of the next level then make it something like 20 levels. use some fun magic for those huge parsed numbers but infinite merge diablo (it would be weapons mainly id think

This project envisions a Diablo-like rogue-lite game centered around an infinite gear merging system, where unique, high-tier merged items are permanently claimed by the first player who creates them.
Is the game's core loop primarily focused on combat and loot acquisition, typical of a Diablo-like, or is there a significant emphasis on the merging mechanic itself as a core gameplay loop? What is the intended platform(s) for this game (e.g., PC, mobile)?

Based on your request, I understand the project involves a system with combat, loot acquisition, and a merging mechanism for items or resources.
To form a more specific understanding, could you clarify: What is the overall context or genre of this system (e.g., a game, a simulation, a management system)? And what specifically is being merged?
did you hear what I said earlier?

Based on your request, my high-level understanding is that I need to act as a senior software architect to analyze a provided project description and generate a structured analysis including extracted information, improvement suggestions, and clarifying questions for a software design document.
To form a basic understanding of the project itself, I need the actual project description. Could you please provide the project description?
