# === New Global Prompt for Coding Planner ===
CODING_PLANNER_TASK_LIST_PROMPT = """You are an expert software architect. Your goal is to create a detailed, actionable task plan based on the provided Product Requirements Document (PRD).
Consider the existing project context, conversation history, and any specific failed tasks that require re-planning.

Inputs:
- PRD: {prd_document}
- Existing Project Summary: {existing_project_summary}
- Conversation History (for context): {conversation_history}
- Failed Task Details (for re-planning, if any): {failed_task_details_str}

Your output MUST be a single JSON list of task objects. Do NOT include any text or markdown formatting outside of this JSON list.
Each task object in the list MUST conform to the following structure:
{{
  "id": "string (globally unique task identifier, e.g., task_001)",
  "name": "string (concise and descriptive name for the task)",
  "description": "string (detailed explanation of what needs to be done for this task, including specific deliverables or outcomes)",
  "dependencies": ["list of strings (IDs of other tasks this task depends on, empty if none)"],
  "acceptance_criteria": ["list of strings (specific, measurable criteria for task completion)"],
  "estimated_effort_hours": "integer (optional, estimated hours to complete the task, e.g., 4)",
  "assignee_suggestion": "string (optional, suggested role or type of assignee, e.g., frontend_dev, backend_dev, any)",
  "status_live": "string (initial status, should usually be 'Todo')",
  "execute_alone": "boolean (true if this task must be executed alone without other parallel tasks, default false)",
  "max_retries": "integer (how many times this task should be retried on failure, e.g., 1)",
  "suggested_branch_name": "string (optional, a suggested Git branch name for this task, e.g., task/setup-database-schema)",
  "planner_status_suggestion": "string (optional, your internal status suggestion for this task in the plan, e.g., todo, needs_clarification)"
}}

Example of the expected JSON list output:
```json
[
  {{
    "id": "task_001",
    "name": "Setup Database Schema",
    "description": "Define and implement the initial database schema based on Appendix A of the PRD. Include tables for Users, Products, and Orders.",
    "dependencies": [],
    "acceptance_criteria": [
      "Users table created with all specified fields.",
      "Products table created with all specified fields.",
      "Orders table created with all specified fields and foreign keys."
    ],
    "estimated_effort_hours": 3,
    "assignee_suggestion": "backend_dev",
    "status_live": "Todo",
    "execute_alone": false,
    "max_retries": 1,
    "suggested_branch_name": "task/setup-db-schema",
    "planner_status_suggestion": "todo"
  }},
  {{
    "id": "task_002",
    "name": "Implement User Authentication API",
    "description": "Develop API endpoints for user registration, login, and logout. Refer to PRD section 3.2 for requirements.",
    "dependencies": ["task_001"],
    "acceptance_criteria": [
      "POST /register endpoint works as specified.",
      "POST /login endpoint authenticates users and returns a token.",
      "POST /logout endpoint invalidates user session."
    ],
    "estimated_effort_hours": 5,
    "assignee_suggestion": "backend_dev",
    "status_live": "Todo",
    "execute_alone": false,
    "max_retries": 1,
    "suggested_branch_name": "task/user-auth-api",
    "planner_status_suggestion": "todo"
  }}
]
```

Ensure all task IDs are unique within the generated plan.
Focus on breaking down the PRD into actionable development tasks that can be implemented and tested.
If re-planning due to a failed task ({failed_task_details_str}), integrate the necessary revisions smoothly, focusing on the failed task and its direct dependents or prerequisites. You may need to modify existing tasks, add new ones, or remove obsolete ones related to the failure.

Now, generate the JSON task list.
